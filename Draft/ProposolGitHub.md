# Proposal for Workshop on "Sustainable Approach for Version Control of Documents"

Subject: Proposal for a 5 day Workshop on "Sustainable Approach for Version Control of Documents"

Keeping in view the challenges faced related to efficient record keeping and management of changes to programs or documents, a workshop on "Sustainable Approach for Version Control of Documents" is proposed in order to automate the manual system. This will lead to reduced computational time, elimination of redundant task and hence smaller environmental footprint.

Most of us are spending a fair amount of our “computer time” just trying to organize and keep track of all of the files associated with our work. This is due to our current manual approach to maintain various versions of the document. Most probably we are saving different versions of same file e.g as notice_exam_16oct, notice_exam_17oct, notice_exam_18oct, notice_exam_final_oct etc. This approach will lead to tens or hundreds of similar files, making it difficult to directly compare different versions, and it is not easy to share among other users. Fig 1 give a snapshot of the current scenario followed by all.

Among the many logistical headaches that we likely deal with on a daily basis using our current practice are:

1.	Updating files or any official documents like notices, scripts or papers, without losing copies of their old version. 
2.	Figuring out what changed between two versions of a file.
3.	Maintaining multiple versions of files that started off the same but then diverged. 
4.	Merging two divergent copies of a file.
5.	Sharing your files (and their history) with the world — or just a few collaborators.
6.	Syncing versions of your files across multiple computers and collaborating with colleagues on files.

In short, a document will generally have several people involved in the drafting, reviewing and editing process, and it is very easy to get into a muddle with tracking which version is the current one, and therefore creating a possibility of working on the wrong file or using out-of-date information. Inorder to address these issues, we need to have a version control system.

Version Control is the management of multiple versions of the same document. It allows to keep track of the documents and helps to easily explore the changes done previously in the same document. 

Why is Version Control Important?
1.	It is important when documents that are being created has to undergo a lot of revisions and redrafting by a number of different users. 
2.	It helps us to track changes and identify when key decisions were made along the way.
3.	It helps to easily find out which version of a document is currently in force, or which version of a policy was in use at a particular time. 

The easiest way to manage versions of the documents is to use open source software tools. Every time, when a document is saved back to the repository, software creates a new version which enables to see the changes that have been made.
There are many open source tools used for version controlling of documents. Git is one among the popular tools for version control systems and is used by some of the largest companies in the entire world. 

It forms good records keeping practice which is mandatory conditions for ISO 9001 certified institutions.

## Expected outcome

Following will be the benefits of the course:
1. It will help to manage version control of every document easily and free of cost as each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore    the changes that occurred to it at different time points.
2. All files necessary for certain analysis can be held together and people can add in their documents the required images, urls, graphs, etc. 
3. It will enable to review other people’s documents, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. 
4. It will help to maintain online backup of data. Everyone who has rights can access the data.
