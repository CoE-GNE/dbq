Duration: 20 hours (5 days @ 4 hours per day), includes on-line lectures,

## Necessity of workshop

The functioning of any individual or any organisation is depending on
documentation. It may be:

1. Resume
1. Work experience
1. Project report
1. Budget
1. Corporate annual report
1. Notices
1. Brochures
1. Invitation letter / cards

and what not.

Can you imagine any one of above is finalised is a single shot, or only one
person is handling it?

No, a big *NO*. That never happen. Even a small document, lile office memo,
notice goes to a number of revisions and every thing involve mutiple
persons.

Same is the case with any publicaton, technical report, research report,
thesis, academic report, convocation address.

Most of us, most of the time maintaing various revisions by giving
appropriat names (enjoy Comic in Fig 1 below), and sending latest edition / version
to other involved (through pen-drive or e-mails) for incorporating in their
work or for review.

Fig 1 gives a snapshot of the current scenario followed by most of people.

Is this a right approach?

Definitely no.

There is always challenge of making is sure that latest changes of inputs
from all team members have been incorporated in to final report.

What is the way out?

This workshop will be the answer.

This workshop wil give you all necessary tools, handon pratical sessions to
solve all these issue, and making sure that computer resources are used
efficiently and with the provision to track who proposed the changes or who
drafted what and who approved that, later any time, and roll-back, if there
is necessity of that. 

## Why is Version Control Important?

1. It is important when documents that are being created has to undergo a
lot of revisions and redrafting by a number of different users.
1. It helps us to track changes and identify when key decisions were made
along the way.
1. It helps to easily find out which version of a document is currently in
force, or which version of a policy was in use at a particular time.

Revision or version control system forms good records keeping practice
which is mandatory conditions for all ISO 9001 certified organisations.

## Expected outcome

Following will be the benefits to attendees of the workshop:

1. Learn to manage version control of every document easily, making it easy
to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points.

1. Learn to keep all files necessary for a particular project in a central
repository, and give access to autorise persons, with tracking ability. In
that central repository team members can add in their documents the required
images, links, graphs, etc.
1. Learn to review other peopleâ€™s documents, add comments to certain lines
or the overall document, and suggest changes.
1. Learn maintain online backup of data. Everyone who has rights can
access the data.
1. Learn the ways to reduce ussage of computer resources.
