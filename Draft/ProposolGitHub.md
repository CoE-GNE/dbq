# Proposal for Workshop on Version Control of Documents

Subject: Proposal for 5 day Course under TEQIP III

This course is basically for the improving the skills of miscellaneous staff to keep the record on the github for automating the manual system in the college. 

Version Control is the management of multiple versions of the same document. It allows to keep track of the documents and helps to easily explore the changes done previously in the same document. 
Currently we are following manual approach to maintain various versions of the document. Most probably we are saving different versions of same file e.g as notice_exam_16oct, notice_exam_17oct , notice_exam_18oct, notice_exam_final_oct etc. This approach will save tens or hundreds of similar files, making it difficult to directly compare different versions, and it  is not easy to share among other users. Fig1 give a snapshot of the current scenario followed by all.

A document will generally have several people involved in the drafting, reviewing and editing process, and it is very easy to get into a muddle with tracking which version is the current one, and therefore creating a possibility of working on the wrong file or using out-of-date information. 

Why is Version Control Important?
1.	It is important  when documents are being created has to undergo a lot of revision and redrafting by a number of different users. 
2.	It helps us to track changes and identify when key decisions were made along the way.
3.	It helps to easily find out which version of a document  is currently in force, or which version of a policy was in use at a particular time. 

It forms good records keeping practice which is mandatory conditions for ISO 9001 certified institutions.

Version Control of Documents using Git

The easiest way to manage versions of the documents is to use open source software tools. Every time, when a document is saved back to the repository, software creates a new version which enables to see the changes that have been made.
There are many open source tools used for version controlling of documents. Git  is one among the popular tools for version control systems and is used by some of the largest companies in the entire world

## Expected outcome

Following will the benefits of the course:
1. It helps to manage version control of every document easily and free of cost as each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points.
2. All files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their documents code, graphs, etc.  e.g It benifits in collecting data from different departments. 
3. It enables to review other peopleâ€™s documents code, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. e.g in BOS meeting syllabus is shared with experts and they give their comments.With the help  of Git all the comments are stored in file.
4. It helps to maintain online backup of data. Everyone who  has right can access the data .e.g all notifications can be stored at one place rather than in files.
